# 🦎 lotl — Markdown to PDF with Axolotl Power

**lotl** is a fast, simple CLI tool to convert your Markdown files into beautiful PDFs — with themes, margins, headers, footers, and even recursive directory conversion.
Powered by [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), [marked](https://marked.js.org/), and a little axolotl magic. ✨

## 🎨 Themes

* **github** – clean and familiar GitHub-style
* **dark** – dark mode for night owls
* **minimal** – clean, serif-based look

You can also import the theme list in JavaScript:

```js
import { themes } from 'lotl';
console.log(Object.keys(themes)); // ['github', 'dark', 'minimal']
```

---

## 📜 Programmatic API

You can also use **lotl** directly in your Node.js code:

```js
import { convertMdToPdf, themes } from 'lotl';

await convertMdToPdf('README.md', 'output.pdf', {
  theme: 'dark',
  format: 'Letter',
  margin: '25mm',
  header: false
});
```

---

## 🛠 Development

```bash
npm install       # install dependencies
npm link          # link CLI locally
npm start         # run CLI from source
```

**Transparency Note:** Most of this project was created using AI assistance. I (Poran Dip) wanted a MD to PDF converter CLI, and I wanted it *yesterday*, so AI was used to achieve that. I'm including this both for transparency and as a little flex in prompt engineering skills. 😎 However, that also means to expect bugs and things to break, and I'd love if you could open issues about them! I'll maintain this for a while and actually make proper changes myself, as needed.
